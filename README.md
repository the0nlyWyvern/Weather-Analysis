## Data source

Link dataset: [Historical weather data of 194 country capitals](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balabaskar/historical-weather-data-of-all-country-capitals?fbclid=IwAR21Wdo604qhyYh4g_p3j2r22lQIrRBAaNnw0KW2Q5mLz7LDrshPs7fx3kA "kaggle.com")  
Weather is the state of atmosphere at some point which varies in different places around the globe. Analyzing weather data can help us determine the main climate of some regions or gain some useful insights into how the weather of some specific locations have changed over years.  
This dataset comprises the daily weather data recorded in the capital of 194 countries all over the world. The data contains the following columns:

- **date** - weather data recorded date
- **country** - name of the country
- **city** - name of the city
- **Latitude** - latitude value of the city location
- **Longitude** - longitude value of the city location
- **tavg** - The average air temperature in 째C
- **tmin** - The minimum air temperature in 째C
- **tmax** - The maximum air temperature in 째C
- **wdir** - The average wind direction in degrees (째)
- **wspd** - The average wind speed in km/h
- **pres** - The average sea-level air pressure in hPa

According to author, the data is extracted from [Meteostat](https://meteostat.net/en/) through API.
